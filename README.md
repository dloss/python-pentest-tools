Python tools for penetration testers
====================================

If you are involved in vulnerability research, reverse engineering or
penetration testing, I suggest to try out the
[Python](http://www.python.org) programming language. It has a rich set
of useful libraries and programs. This page lists some of them.

Most of the listed tools are written in Python, others are just Python
bindings for existing C libraries, i.e. they make those libraries easily
usable from Python programs.

Some of the more aggressive tools (pentest frameworks, bluetooth
smashers, web application vulnerability scanners, war-dialers, etc.) are
left out, because the legal situation of these tools is still a bit
unclear in Germany -- even after the [decision of the highest
court](http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen/rk20090518_2bvr223307.html).
This list is clearly meant to help whitehats, and for now I prefer to
err on the safe side.
